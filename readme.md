These files are set up to be added to the 'Archipelago-main' source code and meant to be ran via the SuperPaperMarioClient.py (which should be placed directly in Archipelago-main)
to be able to actually run the client and connect and whatever you'll have to install the .apworld into the archipelago client

this is all very much WIP and literally everything is subject to change

why are you still here
